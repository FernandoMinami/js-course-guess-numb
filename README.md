# js-course-guess-numb
This is a game created by me, using the course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!" From Udemy.

In this course I used what I've used the basics in Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a quick game where the object is to lead the player to find a random number, from 1 up to 20, only by irforming if the guessed number is too high or too low. The player will have only 20 lives to find the number.

The game can be found working on the site: https://maxrabbitdesign.com/projects/Course-Projects/01-Guess-My-Number/
